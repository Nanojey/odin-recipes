        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

        <p>A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday 
            complete, and this version can be on the table in no 
            time at all thanks to just four ingredients from your 
            pantry or fridge: canned green beans, condensed 
            mushroom soup, French-fried onions, and shredded 
            Cheddar cheese.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>

            <li><p><strong>Green beans</strong>: This easy green bean casserole starts 
                with two drained cans of green beans.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Canned soup</strong>: A can of condensed cream of mushroom 
                soup creates a creamy texture and adds savory flavor.
            </p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Cheese</strong>: This recipe calls for shredded Cheddar 
                cheese. Use sharp, mild, or a blend of both.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>French-fried onions</strong>: The green bean casserole gets 
                its crunch from a French-fried onion topping.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Optional ingredients</strong>: Crumbled bacon, sautéed 
                mushrooms or onions, garlic, Parmesan cheese, 
                black pepper</p></li>
